Fragment-based binning scheme for sgains
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Summary: The following scripts are used to create a binning scheme based on fragments that come from pair-end sequencing reads.
Using fragments rather than single reads provides more specific information that could be useful (fragment length, GC content etc).
A hybrid reference genome is used here (human hg19 and fly dm6 chromosomes are both used).
All bash scripts can be found in Normalflyze/scripts and all python scripts can be found in Normaflyze/python_scripts.


1) make_hybrid_index.sh 										(location: Normaflyze/scripts)
Summary: creates the Bowtie index for the hybrid reference genome
*This step already exists in the pipeline, and I made no changes that are relevant to this pipeline (I just applied it to the human+fly hybrid genome).

	a) hg19_mask_Y.py - **same as hg19.chrY.psr.py**			(Normaflyze/python_scripts)
	input: 
		- the .fa file of the hg19 Y chromosome
		- the name of the modified file to be output
	output:
		- fasta file for a modified Y chromosome; pseudoautosomal regions removed

	b) sep_drosoph_genome.py 									(Normaflyze/python_scripts)
	inputs:
		- a single large fasta file containing all chromosomes in a reference genome (fly in this case)
		- the destination where the new files should be placed
	output:
		- several fasta files, separated by each chromosome in the input file.
	c) Call Bowtie-build to create the index.


2) generate_paired_reads.sh 									(Normaflyze/scripts)
info: creates fastq files, formatted for pair-end read alignment. Applied to hybrid reference genome, using Nla3 cutsites and read lengths of 150.

	a) generate_paired_reads.py 								(Normaflyze/python_scripts)
	input:
		- path to the reference genome being used. The directory must only contain .fa files, with one for each chromosome in the reference genome.
		- the desired length of reads
		- the cut site where reads start (Nla3 in this case)
	output:
		- 2 files formatted as FASTQ paired end read files
		- 1 text file containing fragment lengths


3) map_paired_fastq.sh 											(Normaflyze/scripts)
Summary: calls Bowtie aligner on paired-end fastq files. Outputs SAM alignment


4) get_bin_bounds.sh											(Normaflyze/scripts)
Summary: creates 5000 bins for the reference genome. 
Removes theoretical alignments for fragments that don't fall within a certain range (this is hardcoded in, but it came from distribution of real data).
The result is a text file containing: chromosome, bin start pos, absolute bin start pos, chrom bin end, bin length, number of reads 

	a) chrom_sizes.py
	input:
		- path to the reference genome
		- the desired name of the output file
	output:
		- text file containing chrom names, absolute start positions, and lengths; sorted by absolute position, with all hg19 first then all dm6

	b) get_goodzones.py
	Note: "goodzones" aren't defined the same way as before. Here, each zone that is given in the output .bed is an individual fragment.
	input:
		- the SAM alignment file for the simulated paired-end reads
	output:
		- a .bed file containing info for every alignment: chromsome, absolute start position of alignment, and abs end position of alignment  
		(different format from old version)
		- a text file containing each chromosome and the number of fragments that are mapped to that chromosome (same as old version)

	c) sep_bin_boundaries.py
	input:
		- the txt file containg # of alignments per chromosome (from get_goodzones.py)
		- the .bed file containing all alignments (from get_goodzones.py). Must be sorted in lexicographic order by chromosome name, then by position.
		- the file containing the sizes of each chromosome.
		- destination where the bin boundary output will be placed
	output:
		- a text file containing the bin boundaries for the hybrid genome: chromosome, chrom bin pos, absolute bin start pos, 
		chrom bin end, bin length, number of reads mapping to the bin

Additions to the normalization procedure
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

5) normalize_GC_segment.R 					(Normaflyze/R_scripts)
Summary: normalizes hybrid sequence data by mean bin GC-content and median fragment length in each bin. 
The relevant addition here is the noramlization based on fragment length by the function lowess.norm(). 
This is used specifically to normalize a hybrid human/fly genome. If just a human genome is being analyzed, 
the older lowess.gc() function can be used again, but with the length information as the first parameter.
input:
	- requires correctly formatted "uber" data file containing bin counts, for all the samples being analyzed (same as before)
	- file specifying mean GC content of each bin (same)
	- file specifying median fragment length for each bin (new)

6) compute_gc_content.sh 				(Normaflyze/scripts)
Summary: generates the files detailing GC content and median fragment lengths for bins.
	a) compute_gc_content.py 			(Normaflyze/python_scripts)
	Note: nothing significant was changed here from previous versions
	input:
		- directory where the genome fasta files are held
		- the sorted bin boundaries file
	output:
		- text file containin bin boundaries as well as average GC content for each bin

	b) compute_len_distrib.py
	input:
		-the sorted bin boundaries file
		- the .bed file containing all the alignments (from get_goodzones)
	output:
		- file detailing median fragment length for each bin, which is used as an input for (5).

Some useful files for understanding formatting: all are truncated on git due to large size

7) sorted_mappers_125_600_TRUNC.bed
info: contains the chromosome and start and end positions of each alignment
output from (4b)
input to (6b) and (4c)

8) range125_600_LEN_TRUNC.txt
info: contains bin boundary info as well as the median length of each bin
output from (6b)
input to (5)

9) range125_600_GC_TRUNC.txt
info: contains bin boundary info as well as the GC content of each bin
output from (6a)
input to (5)
